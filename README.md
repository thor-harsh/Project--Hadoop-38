**In this project We will use Spark with Python to do an amazing stuff.Here we will work on the walmart_stock.csv and complete the challenges as provided by Jose Portilla .** <br></br>

**Before jumping to the code lets understand MapReduce First**...<br></br>

**What is MapReduce?** <br></br>

MapReduce is a programming paradigm that enables massive scalability across hundreds or thousands of servers in a Hadoop cluster. As the processing component, MapReduce is the heart of Apache Hadoop. The term "MapReduce" refers to two separate and distinct tasks that Hadoop programs perform.
A MapReduce program is composed of a map procedure, which performs filtering and sorting, and a reduce method, which performs a summary operation.



**Important Note: Go through the Marvel+Graph and Marvel+Names files before jumping to the code.**
