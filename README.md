# Project--Hadoop-38

<table>
  
**In this project We will use Spark with Python to do an amazing stuff.Here we will work on the walmart_stock.csv and complete the challenges as provided by Jose Portilla .** <br></br>

**Before jumping to the code lets understand Spark First**...<br></br>

**What is Apache Spark?** <br></br>

Apache Spark‚Ñ¢ is a multi-language engine for executing data engineering, data science, and machine learning on single-node machines or clusters.<br></br>
Unify the processing of your data in batches and real-time streaming, using your preferred language: Python, SQL, Scala, Java or R.
Execute fast, distributed ANSI SQL queries for dashboarding and ad-hoc reporting. Runs faster than most data warehouses.<br></br>
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on petabyte-scale data without having to resort to downsampling.
Train machine learning algorithms on a laptop and use the same code to scale to fault-tolerant clusters of thousands of machines.<br></br>



**Important Note: Go through the Marvel+Graph and Marvel+Names files before jumping to the code.**

**So what are you waiting for...? Jump to the code to get started. As usual for any doubt or query see you in pull request section üòÅüòÇ. Thanks!**
